# parseGutenberg

This work belongs to my Blog "Node.js vs C++" on doITso.de
It creates a bulk import file (in Json format) to import for Elasticsearch equivalent to the Node.js implementation described in the book "Node.js 8 the Right Way" from pragprog.com
See the Blog for details.

This coding was a finger excercise for using C++ and TDD and learning an alternative XML parser (CMarkup) after years of using Xerces parsers in my professional project work. It came out, CMarkup is not the best choice for the RDF files to be processed but I made it working in an - let's say - unintended way of using CMarkup. If hope someone can show us the right way of using it here.
